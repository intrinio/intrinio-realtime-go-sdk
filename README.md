## Example Usage
```go

package main

import (
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"sync"
	"syscall"

	"github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-go-sdk"
)

func handleEquityTrade(trade intrinio.EquityTrade) {
}

func handleEquityQuote(quote intrinio.EquityQuote) {
}

func handleOptionRefresh(refresh intrinio.OptionRefresh) {
}

func handleOptionTrade(trade intrinio.OptionTrade) {
}

func handleOptionQuote(quote intrinio.OptionQuote) {
}

func handleOptionUA(ua intrinio.OptionUnusualActivity) {
}

func main() {
	var equitiesConfig intrinio.Config = intrinio.LoadConfig("equities-config.json")
	var optionsConfig intrinio.Config = intrinio.LoadConfig("options-config.json")
	var equitiesClient *intrinio.Client = intrinio.NewEquitiesClient(equitiesConfig, handleEquityTrade, handleEquityQuote)
	var optionsClient *intrinio.Client = intrinio.NewOptionsClient(optionsConfig, handleOptionTrade, nil, handleOptionRefresh, nil)
	close := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(close, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	equitiesClient.Start()
	optionsClient.Start()
	symbols := []string{"GE", "MSFT"}
	equitiesClient.JoinMany(symbols)
	optionsClient.JoinMany(symbols)
	//client.JoinLobby()
	<-close
	equitiesClient.Stop()
	optionsClient.Stop()
}
```

## Usage notes (applies to both equity and option clients)

There are thousands of securities and millions of options contracts, each with their own feed of activity.
We highly encourage you to make your callback methods (e.g. onTrade, onQuote, onUnusualActivity, onRefresh) as short as possible and follow a queue pattern so your app can handle the large volume of activity.
Note that quotes (ask and bid updates) comprise 90-99% of the volume of the entire feed. Be cautious when deciding to receive quote updates. With the option feed, you will receive the latest 'ask' and 'bid' price with each each trade update. You may subscribe to receive a quote updates for ask/bid prices (by providing an OnQuote callback to `intrinio.NewOptionsClient` or `intrinio.NewEquitiesClient`) but, again, we recommend caution when electing to do this.

## Providers

Currently, Intrino offers realtime data for this SDK from the following providers:

* DSIP - Delayed SIP
* OPRA - The Option Price Reporting Authority

Please be sure that the correct provider is specified in the `intrinio.Config` object(s) that are passed to the `intrinio.NewEquitiesClient` or `intrinio.NewOptionsClient` routines. DSIP should be specified for an equities client and OPRA should be specified for an options client.

## API Keys

You will receive your Intrinio API Key after [creating an account](https://intrinio.com/signup). You will need a subscription to a [realtime equity data feed](https://intrinio.com/real-time-multi-exchange) or [realtime option data feed](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/options-data) as well.

Please be sure to include you API key in the `intrinio.Config` object passed to either the `intrinio.NewEquitiesClient` or `intrinio.NewOptionsClient` routine.

Alternatively, you may create an environment variable, `INTRINIO_API_KEY`, and set your API key as the value. The `intrinio.LoadConfig(filename)` function will pick it up from there, automatically. 

## Documentation

### Overview

The Intrinio Realtime Client will handle authorization as well as establishment and management of all necessary WebSocket connections. All you need to get started is your API key.
The first thing that you'll do is create a new `intrinio.Client` object using either the `NewEquitiesClient` or `NewOptionsClient` routine, passing in an `intrinio.Config` object as well as a series of callback functions. These callback methods tell the client what types of subscriptions you will be setting up.
A helper function, `intrinio.LoadConfig(filename string)`, is provided to automatically load a `.json` file that exists in your application's working directory. Please be sure that your API key is specified in the `intrinio.Config` object that is passed to one of the `intrinio.New[Equities/Options]Client` routine.
Creating an `intrinio.Client` object will initialize the object but you will need to call the client object's `Start()` method in order to open the session and start communication with the server.
After an `intrinio.Client` object has been created and started, you may subscribe to receive feed updates from the server.
You may subscribe, dynamically, to individual or multiple ticker symbols (in the case of an Equities client) or to option contracts, option chains, or a mixed list thereof (in the case of an Options client).
It is also possible to subscribe to the entire universe of ticker symbols or option contracts (i.e. the firehose) by calling the client object's `JoinLobby()` method.
The volume of data provided by the `Firehose` can exceed 100Mbps and requires special authorization.
You may update your subscriptions on the fly, using the client object's `Join` and `Leave` methods.
The WebSocket client is designed for near-indefinite operation. It will automatically reconnect if a connection drops/fails and when then servers turn on every morning.
If you wish to perform a shutdown of the application, please call the client's `Stop` method. See the example application for an example of how to handle system SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM signals

### Methods

`var client Client = NewEquitiesClient(config, onTrade, onQuote)` - Creates an Intrinio Real-Time client for use with a real-time equity feed (DSIP).
* **Parameter** `config`: Required. The configuration object necessary to set up the client.
* **Parameter** `onTrade`: Required. The callback accepting `intrinio.EquityTrade` updates.
* **Parameter** `onQuote`: Optional. The callback accepting `intrinio.EquityQuote` updates. If `onQuote` is `nil`, you will not receive quote (ask, bid) updates from the server.

`var client Client = NewOptionsClient(config, onTrade, onQuote, onRefresh, onUnusualActivity)` - Creates an Intrinio Real-Time client for use with a real-time option feed (OPRA).
* **Parameter** `config`: Required. The configuration object necessary to set up the client.
* **Parameter** `onTrade`: Optional. The callback accepting `intrinio.OptionTrade` updates. If `onTrade` is `nil`, you will not receive trade updates from the server.
* **Parameter** `onQuote`: Optional. The callback accepting `intrinio.OptionQuote` updates. If `onQuote` is `nil`, you will not receive quote (ask, bid) updates from the server.
* **Parameter** `onRefresh`: Optional. The callback accepting `intrinio.OptionRefresh` updates. If `onRefresh` is `nil`, you will not receive open interest, open, close, high, low data from the server. Note: open interest data is only updated at the beginning of every trading day. If this callback is provided you will recieve an update immediately, as well as every 15 minutes (approx).
* **Parameter** `onUnusualActivity`: Optional. The callback accepting `intrinio.OptionUnusualActivity` updats. If `onUnusualActivity` is `nil`, you will not receive unusual activity updates from the server.

`client.Start()` - Starts the client (authenticates the user and establishes the websocket connection)
`client.Stop()` - Leaves all joined channels and gracefully terminates the session. 

`client.Join(symbol string)` - Joins the channel identified by the given symbol, contractId, or option chain (e.g. "AAPL" or "GOOG__210917C01040000")
`client.JoinMany(symbols []string)` - Joins the channels identified by the given symbol slice (e.g. `[]string{"AAPL", "MSFT__210917C00180000", "GOOG__210917C01040000"}`)
`client.JoinLobby()` - Joins the lobby (i.e. 'Firehose') channel. This requires special account permissions.

`client.LeaveAll()` - Leaves all channels that have been subscribed to by the client
`client.Leave(symbol string)` - Leaves the channel identified by the given symbol
`client.LeaveMany(symbols []string)` - Leaves the channels identified by the given symbol slice
`client.LeaveLobby()` - Leaves the lobby channel.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through a configuration object (`intrinio.Config`) that is passed to the `intrinio.New[Equities/Options]Client` routine. You may create a configuration directly, in code, like so:

```go
var config intrinio.Config = intrinio.Config{ApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", Provider: "OPRA/DSIP"}
```

 Or, you can create `.json` config files, of the following form, and place them in your application root. An example of this is provided in the sample project.


```json
{
	"ApiKey": "YOUR-API-KEY",
	"Provider": "OPRA/DSIP",
}
```

You can then create your config objects using:

```go
var config intrinio.Config = intrinio.LoadConfig("[options/equities]Config.json")
```
